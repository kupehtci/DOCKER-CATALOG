# OracleDB Docker

This folder contains a docker compose file that deploys a testing Oracle DB for developing. 

Also provides a `oracle_access.py` python script that checks the connection to the container from the local host and extract some DB information. 

## Notes

The service name of the free OracleDB is `FREE`.
